               <p>"Why am I telling such a morbid story? Partly because I have dark sense of humor, but also as a way to process how my childhood home is what I'm sure Steven King had in mind when he wrote Pet Semetary. How many cats total did the Bly's have, you ask? After comparing notes with my two older brothers, we estimate that we had at least 18 cats over the span of 18 years. Don't worry, not all of them died terrible deaths. But our house was still pretty much a kitty death house."</p>

     <p>Squeaker</p>
         <p>Squeaker was a handsome black cat. He was graceful and loved cuddling. His brother was Sleepy. About 3 weeks before Halloween one year, Squeaker went missing. He came back a week before Halloween with his stomach shaved. We tried keeping him inside the rest of that month, or at least until after Halloween, but he managed to get out and he never came back. Pretty sure someone who was superstitious or into the occult killed him.</p>
     <p>Hop-a-long</p>
         <p>Quite possibly one of the meanest cats ever. He was a 3-legged cat (hence the name) whose favorite pastimes were hissing and swatting at anyone who tried to love him. He looked ROUGH because he was originally a streetcat. I don't think I've ever successfully pet him and I have no idea why we kept him as he was more likely to murder us in our sleep than ever cuddle us. Even though Hop-along was a jerk, he still didn't deserve to die the way that he did. There were a bunch of mean kids in our neighborhood that had BB guns; and so one morning we found him shot to death near our rose bush. We never found out who murdered him.</p>
     <p>Cuddles</p>
         <p>Cuddles was a fluffy grey long-haired cat. She was stuck up and prissy and contrary to her name, would never deign to cuddle us peasants. It was winter when </p>

     <p>Mr. Sweetums</p>
     <p>Smokey</p>
     <p>Freckles</p>
         <p>Freckles was a plump pear shaped black calico cat. She seriously had the smallest head attached to a massive body. I never heard her meow and she generally kept to herself. Freckles got some illness that caused her to waste away until she got unbelievably </p>
     <p>Mo</p>
         <p>Mo was a huge regal long haired dark tabby cat. His paws were massive and he loved to play in the snow. We called him Mo for the 'M' marking on his forehead</p>
     <p>Bear</p>
       <p>Bear was such a loving and playful cat. He was a beautiful long haired black cat with a tail that looked like a magnificent plume. The strange thing about Bear's death, is his death is still unconfirmed. Bear was an inside cat and got out one day and didn't come back in. A couple months later I found him in the bushes and he had gone feral with the wildest looking eyes. Bear had obviously seen and been through some things, liked he'd just come back from kitty 'Nam or something. He ran away when I tried to get close to pet him, and we never saw him again after that. </p>
     <p>Nicky</p>
         <p>Possibly the dumbest cat we've ever owned. This cat had no sense of self-preservation and would regularly walk up to nuzzle and rub up against dogs that had recently attacked him or legitimately tried to eat him. After a while, dogs knew something was obviously off with Nicky and did not try to eat him</p>
     <p>Andy</p>
         <p>He was Nicky's twin brother, and he obviously got all of the brains and charm out of the two of them. He was my Dad's favorite </p>
